/** 
 * Task # 32
 * Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone 
 * has a unique username.
 * • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
 * • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also 
 *   in the current_users list.
 • • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message 
 *   that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying 
 *   that the username is available.
 * • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
