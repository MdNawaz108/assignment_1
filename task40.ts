/**
 * Task # 40
 * Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should
 * take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
 * Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that
 * Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you
 * to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add
 * that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
 * Date : 10/02/2022
